Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight and won't fall on your head. A large network of tunnels many levels deep would fix congestion in any city, no matter how large it grew (just keep adding levels). The key to making this work is increasing tunneling speed and dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more â€“ this is the goal of The Boring Company.</p></div></article><article class="what__article"><div class="what__article-photo"></div><div class="what__article-text"><img alt="" class="what__article-logo" src="https://picsum.photos/150/50/?random&4"><p>A Hyperloop is a proposed mode of passenger and/or freight transportation, first used to describe an open-source vactrain design released by a joint team from Tesla and SpaceX. Drawing heavily from Robert Goddard's vactrain, a hyperloop is a sealed tube or system of tubes through which a pod may travel free of air resistance or friction conveying people or objects at high speed while being very efficient.</p></div></article></section><section class="tweets-section"><h2>Latest Tweets</h2></section><section class="follow-section"><h2>Follow</h2><article class="follow__group"><h6 class="follow__header">Twitter</h6><ul class="follow__links"><li><a href="#">Elon Musk</a></li><li><a href="#">SpaceX</a></li><li><a href="#">Tesla</a></li></ul></article><article class="follow__group"><h6 class="follow__header">Twitter</h6><ul class="follow__links"><li><a href="#">Elon Musk</a></li><li><a href="#">SpaceX</a></li><li><a href="#">Tesla</a></li></ul></article><article class="follow__group"><h6 class="follow__header">Twitter</h6><ul class="follow__links"><li><a href="#">Elon Musk</a></li><li><a href="#">SpaceX</a></li><li><a href="#">Tesla</a></li></ul></article></section></main><script src="js/main.js"></script></body></html>
